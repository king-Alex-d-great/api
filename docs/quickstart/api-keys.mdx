WalletKit is a set of APIs and no-code tools. To access any of the APIs, you need a `Project ID` and an `API Key`. You
can get these for free by creating a WalletKit account.

1. Head over to https://app.usewalletkit.com and create a free account
2. On the [API Keys](https://app.usewalletkit.com/api-keys) page, you will see your `Project ID` and `API Key`


### Test Mode
When you sign up, you will notice that the Test Mode is on by default. This means that all API calls and data you see
in the dashboard for on the testnet. For example, if the selected network is Ethereum, the test mode subnet is Ethereum
Sepolia.

You can complete your entire development and testing in Test Mode. You should switch to mainnet before
releasing your product to users.
