In this guide, we'll go over how wallet recovery works.

As mentioned in [Wallet Control Modes](/introduction/wallet-control-modes#user-controlled-wallets), one of the three secret shares is recovery share.
There are many ways to manage the recovery share, and each one has its own pros and cons, for example, 
1. storing in offline by user like write it down on a paper requires less trust on 3rd party but put burden on user to secure the share.
2. security questions, removes the secure store burden from user but requires more trust on the party who stores the recovery share.

WalletKit tries to find the balance between user experience and trust needed on other party.

### How it works
Recovery share is encrypted by developer's public key store by WalletKit. Used only for recovery purposes.

To recover, we use WalletKit share + Recovery share:
1. User authenticates themselves (email/phone/passkey)
2. Developer uses their private key for Recovery share.

Developers implement their own policy at which they help with the recovery process
