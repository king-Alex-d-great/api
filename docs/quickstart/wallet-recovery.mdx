In this guide, we'll go over how wallet recovery works.

As mentioned in [Wallet Control Modes](/introduction/wallet-control-modes#user-controlled-wallets), one of the three secret shares is recovery share.
There are various methods to manage recovery shares, each with its own trade-offs:
- User's Offline Storage: For instance, writing it on paper. This approach minimizes reliance on third parties but shifts the responsibility to the user for secure storage.
- Trusted Service Storage: A trusted service stores the share, accessible after identity verification, often with security questions. This approach eases the burden on users for secure storage but requires greater trust in the service provider.

WalletKit strives to strike a balance between user experience and trust requirements within the system

### Our Approach
The Recovery Share is encrypted using the developer's public key and securely stored with WalletKit. This share is reserved exclusively for recovery purposes.

To recover, we use WalletKit share + Recovery share:
1. User authenticates themselves (email/phone/passkey)
2. Developer uses their private key for Recovery share.

Developers implement their own policy at which they help with the recovery process
