title: "Reset Wallet PIN"
---

In this guide, we'll go over the steps to enable user to reset their wallet PIN.

### Prerequisites

- [Create Your First Wallet](/quickstart/create-a-user-controlled-wallet) 
- User must know their current PIN to reset it. Otherwise, user should go through the Account Recovery flow.

### 1. Create a walletkit client and obtain session token

See step 1 and 2 in [Create Your First Wallet](/quickstart/create-a-user-controlled-wallet#1-create-a-walletkit-client).

### 2. Reset PIN

Resetting PIN is as simple as an API call.

```javascript NextJS
const resp = await wk.wallets.changeUserPin({
    network: Network.Base,
    address: "0x..",
    oldUserPin: "<old_user_pin>",
    newUserPin: "<new_user_pin>"
});

if (resp.ok && resp.body.success) {
    // User pin changed successfully
} else {
    // User pin change failed
}
```
