title: "Make A Gasless Transfer"

In this guide, we'll go over the steps to make a gasless transfer from a user controlled wallet.

### Prerequisites

- [Create Your First Wallet](/quickstart/create-a-user-controlled-wallet)


### 1. Fund the wallet with some test ERC20 to transfer

Before you can make a transfer, your wallet needs to have some token balance. You can use [WalletKit Faucet](https://faucet.walletkit.com/) to get some test token for free.

### 2. Create a walletkit client and obtain session token

See step 1 and 2 in [Create Your First Wallet](/quickstart/create-a-user-controlled-wallet#1-create-a-walletkit-client).

### 3. Make a gasless transfer

Making a gasless transfer is as simple as making an API call. Since this is a user controlled wallet, you will use `user_pin` set by the user.

```javascript NextJS
const transaction = await wk.tokens.transfer({
  network: WalletKit.Network.Base,
  from: '0x..', // user wallet address
  token: '0xec05f9eb5ebc36732256bc86eaf654c55a20752a', // WalletKit ERC20 test token
  recipient: '0x..',
  amount: '1',
  userPin: "USER_PROVIDED_PIN",
});
```

The call returns a transaction object with a transaction id. You can monitor the status of the transaction by calling the
[Get Transaction Status](/api-reference/transactions/transaction-status-by-id) endpoint. WalletKit handles retries to
ensure that the transaction is successful.
