The wallets created on WalletKit are either controlled by you (i.e. The Developer) or the end user. WalletKit does not
maintain custody of any wallets.

For many APIs, such as [create wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet) or
[transfer tokens](/api-reference/tokens/transfer-token), you will need to specify a `developer_secret`. This guide explains how
to use this field correctly.

<Note>For more in-depth information on the wallet custody models, [see here](/introduction/wallet-control-model)</Note>

### Developer-Controlled Wallets
If you maintain custody of all user wallets, the `developer_secret` is a secure password that must be kept on your servers and
never shared with anyone. The `developer_secret` is used to encrypt your share of the private key, stored by WalletKit.

When an API requires the secret, you must send the secret in the request body. This allows WalletKit to decrypt your
share of the private key and sign the transaction.

<Tip>
  In Test Mode, the `developer_secret` is always `testnet-secret`.
</Tip>

### User-Controlled Wallets
If you want users to maintain custody of their own wallets, you will use `user_pin` set by each user. You must never
store the `user_pin` on your servers.

The `user_pin` set by the user can be a 6-digit pincode or a password. The `user_pin` is used to encrypt the user's
share of the private key, stored by WalletKit.
