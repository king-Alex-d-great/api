<Steps>
    <Step title="Send an email with OTP">
    Using the WalletKit client, send an email to the user's email address. This will contain a one-time password (OTP) that the user will use to verify their email address.

    ```typescript Typescript
    const wk = new WalletKitClient({..});

    const loginWithEmailResp = await wk.users.loginWithEmail({
        email: "<user email>",
    })
    if (!loginWithEmailResp.ok) {
        // handle error
    }

    // store this for later use
    const userId = loginWithEmailResp.body.userId;
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify email">
    In your app, ask the user to enter the verification code they received in their email. Once they enter the code, send it to WalletKit to verify the email address.

    ```typescript Typescript
    const verifyLoginResp = await wk.users.verifyLogin({
        userId: loginWithEmailResp.body.userId,
        verificationCode: "<code from email>",
    });
    if (!verifyLoginResp.ok) {
        // handle error
    }
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Handle access token">
    If you are using one of the WalletKit SDKs, you can skip this step - the SDK will handle this for you.

    If you are using the WalletKit API directly, you will need to store the access token returned by the `verify-login` call. This token is used to authenticate the user in subsequent API calls.

    ```bash curl
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/wallets \
      --header 'X-WalletKit-Project-ID: <Project ID>' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <Access Token>'
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
