description: Integrate with WalletKit API from server-side applications using your API key
---

Using API Keys is ideal when you have an existing authentication system in place for your users.

<Warning>
    API Keys are intended for server-side use only. You should never expose your API key in any public website or app's client-side code.
</Warning>

### Setup

You can find and manage your API keys in the [WalletKit Dashboard](https://app.usewalletkit.com/api-keys).


Once you have the API key from the WalletKit dashboard, authenticate your requests like so:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript
const wk = new WalletKitClient({
  projectId: "<Your Project ID>",
  token: "<Your API Key>":,
});
```

```bash Curl
curl --request GET \
  --url https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/wallets \
  --header 'X-WalletKit-Project-ID: <Project ID>' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <Your API Key>'
```

</CodeGroup>
