### Control modes

When creating a new wallet, you can choose between two control modes:

- **User**: The user controls the wallet and can sign transactions. You must ask the user for a 6-digit pin and provide it in the request.

- **Developer**: You control the wallet and can sign transactions. You must provide the developer secret in the request.

### Owner ID
The owner id is automatically set to the user id when using user access token. You can safely ignore it in this case.

If you are making server-side requests using your API Key, you can optionally set the owner id to a user id corresponding to your authentication system.
