### Install SDK

```bash
npm install walletkit-js
```

### Initialize Client

Setup the client with your Project ID. You can find your Project ID in the [WalletKit Dashboard](https://app.walletkit.com/api-keys).
```typescript
const wk = new WalletKitClient({
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    store: {
      get: (key: string) => {..},
      set: (key: string, value: string, expires: Date) => {..},
      delete: (key: string) => {..},
    }
})
```

<Info>
At this point, the client is unauthenticated. To authenticate your client, check out the [Authentication](../authentication) section.
</Info>

### The Store

<Info>
You only need to set the `store` object if you are making client-side calls. If you are only making server-side calls, you can skip this section and use the [API key](../authentication/api-key) to authenticate your client.
</Info>

In order to make sure that the client is able to persist data, such as the authentication token, you need to provide a store object. The store object is a simple key-value store that implements the following interface:

```typescript
interface KVStore {
    get(name: string): string | undefined;
    set?(name: string, value: string, expires: Date): void;
    delete?(name: string): void;
}
```

You can use the KVStore interface to store the authentication token in the browser's local storage, or in a cookie.

#### Local Storage

The following example shows how to use the browser's local storage to store the authentication token:

```typescript
const localStorageStore: KVStore = {
    get: (name) => {
        const item = localStorage.getItem(name);
        if (!item) {
            return undefined;
        }

        const { value, expires } = JSON.parse(item);
        if (new Date() > new Date(expires)) {
            localStorage.removeItem(name);
            return undefined;
        }

        return value;
    },
    set: (name, value, expires) => {
        localStorage.setItem(name, JSON.stringify({ value, expires }));
    },
    delete: (name) => localStorage.removeItem(name),
};
```

#### Cookies

The following example shows how to use cookies to store the authentication token.

It uses the `js-cookie` library to set, get and delete cookies.

```bash
npm install js-cookie
```

```typescript
import BrowserCookies from "js-cookie";

const browserCookieStore: KVStore = {
    get: (name) => BrowserCookies.get(name),
    set: (name, value, expires) => {
        BrowserCookies.set(name, value, {
            expires,
            path: "/",
            sameSite: "lax",
            secure: true,
            httpOnly: false,
        });
    },
    delete: (name) => BrowserCookies.remove(name),
};
```

<Note>Note that the `set` and `delete` methods in the `KVStore` interface are optional. This is useful if you need to read an existing authentication token to make calls, but you don't have the ability to modify cookies.</Note>
