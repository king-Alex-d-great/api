title: "Wallet Control Modes"
---
Wallet control mode governs who controls the ability to access to the underlying private keys of the wallets.
WalletKit provides two types of control modes: user-controlled wallet and developer-controlled wallet.

### User-Controlled Wallets
With this mode, the user controls the ability to access the private key of the wallet to interact with the blockchain.
It empowers your app's users with full control over their wallets. Neither Wallekit, nor the developer can access or
transfer a user's assets without their permission.
User-controlled wallet requires user to setup their encryption secret, and complete a recovery flow during onboarding.

#### How it works

WalletKit leverages MPC (Multi-Party Computation) for private key management, dividing the private key into three shares distributed
among multiple parties. The user holds two shares, one for online signing hosted in MPC node and one for recovery which is is typically stored offline.
WalletKit retains the third share in an MPC node. When combined with the user's share, these shares enable signature generation for transaction signing.


### Developer-Controlled Wallets
With this mode, the developer controls the ability to access the private key of the wallet to interact with the blockchain.
That means the developer manages the wallets on users behalf. This mode is suitable for the applications that developer is comfortable
taking custody of the assets on users' wallets. For example, a game application issuing in-game points and assets to users' wallets.
This mode usually result in better user experience as it requires less steps during user onboarding, and less user involvement to
interact with the blockchain.

The developer holds two shares, one for online signing hosted in MPC node and one for recovery which is is typically stored offline.
WalletKit retains the third share in an MPC node. When combined with the developer's share, these shares enable signature generation for transaction signing.
WalletKit can run developer's MPC Node out of the box, and the developer share is encrypted by a developer-provided secret so WalletKit has no access to it
without developer's explicit permission.
