title: "Errors"
---

WalletKit uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, invalid address, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Stripe's servers (these are rare).

Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., transfer amount exceeds balance) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.

| HTTP Status Code     | Description                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 200 - OK             | Everything worked as expected.                        |
| 400 - Bad Request    | The request was invalid, often due to missing a required parameter or invalid parameter. |
| 401 - Unauthorized   | No valid API key provided or invalid session token                           |
| 403 - Forbidden      | The API key/session token doesn't have permissions to perform the request. |
| 404 - Not Found      | The requested resource doesn't exist.                |
| 429 - Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |
| 500 - Server Errors | Something went wrong on WalletKit's end. (These are rare.) |

### Error Response Format
Besides HTTP status code, error response include supplementary JSON fields that provide a more detailed, programmatic description of errors for enhanced error handling.
- code: For some errors that could be handled programmatically, a short string indicating the error code reported.
- message: A human-readable message providing more details about the error.

```json Example
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "code": "balance_insufficient",
  "message": "Transfer amount exceeds balance"
}
```
