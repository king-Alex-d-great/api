title: "Wallet Control Models"
---
Wallet control model governs who controls the ability to access to the underlying private keys of the wallets.
WalletKit provides two types of control model: developer-controlled wallet and user-controlled wallet.

### Developer-Controlled Wallets
With this model, the developer controls the ability to access the private key of the wallet to interact with the blockchain. 
Developer has access to the private keys to signs the transaction on behalf of the user. This model is suitable for 
the applications that developer is comfortable taking custody of the assets on users' wallets. For example, a game application
issuing in-game points and assets to users' wallets. This model usually result in better user experience as it requires less
steps during user onboarding, and less user invovlement to interact with the blockchain.

#### How it works
WalletKit leverages MPC (Multi-Party Computation) to private key management, dividing the private key into three shares distributed 
among multiple parties. The developer holds two shares, one hosted by WalletKit protected by their encryption secret, while the 
recovery share is typically stored offline. To sign a transaction, the two online shares will be used to sign the transaction.

### User-Controlled Wallets
With this model, the user controls the ability to access the private key of the wallet to interact with the blockchain.
It empowers your app's users with full control over their wallets. Neither Wallekit, nor the developer can access or 
transfer a user's assets without their permission.
User-controlled wallet requires user to setup their encryption secret, and complete a recovery flow during onboarding.
