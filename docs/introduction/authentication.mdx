WalletKit API supports two authentication schemes: API keys and access token generated by authentication providers, like Firebase, Supabase.

### API Keys

WalletKit supports Basic Authentication to authenticate your requests. Broadly, this works by passing the
`Authorization: Basic <credentials>` header where `<credentials>` is a base64 encoded string: `Project ID:API Secret`.
You can view and manage your API keys in the WalletKit Dashboard [API Keys page](https://app.usewalletkit.com/api-keys).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure. Don't share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

### Access Token Authentication
This is usually used on client-side code where using API key is not possible, request is limited to the scope of the authenticated user.
This works by passing the `Authorization: Bearer <access token>` where the access token can come from either of the following:
1. Generate access token using WalletKit using one of the following methods:
    - Use the [Login with Email](/api-reference/users/login-with-email) + [Verify Login](/api-reference/users/verify-login) endpoints to get an access token
    - Use the [Login Anonymously](/api-reference/users/login-anonymously) endpoint to get an access token

2. Use an existing access token generated by [Supabase](https://supabase.io/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), or other compatible providers in the Authorization header.
    - Setup required: register your Firebase/Supabase ProjectID, JWT Secret in [Project Settings](https://app.usewalletkit.com/settings)
