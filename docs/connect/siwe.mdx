<Info>This feature is only available if you're using wagmi</Info>

Let users make gasless and batched transactions even if they have signed in to your app using an EOA wallet via MetaMask, Coinbase, WalletConnect, or similar external connectors.

Use the `useSIWE` hook to let users create a smart wallet by WalletKit by signing a message with their EOA wallet.

```typescript
export function EnableGaslessButton() {
  const { siweAsync, address, status } = useSIWE();

  console.log("EOA Address": address);

  return (
    <button disabled={status !== "idle"}>
      {status === "pending" ? "Check Wallet.." : "Enable Gasless"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Once a user has completed this process, you can now use other hooks like [sendTransaction](send-transaction) or [useBatchWriteContract](batch-transactions) to make gasless transactions.
