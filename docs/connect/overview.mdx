### What is Connect?

Connect is a set of simple, beautiful, and customizable React components that you can use to onboard users to your app. Users can sign up and create a wallet using their email or social logins. All wallets are gasless by default and users can start making transactions without having to fund their wallets with gas.

### Gasless Experience
With Connect, all wallets are smart wallets by default. And by all, we mean all - users can even create smart wallets secured by their existing EOA wallets. You don't have to worry about paymaster, bundlers, or any other infrastructure.

With smart wallets, your users can start making transactions without having to fund their wallets with gas.

More advanced features such as batched transactions are supported out of the box. For instance, users can now approve and spend in a single on-chain transaction.
