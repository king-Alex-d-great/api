Gas is a fundamental concept in blockchain. As implied by the name, gas serves as the measurement of cost to perform an 
action on the blockchain. The cost includes computational cost of execution as well as the cost of data storage.
<Tip>
Only the write operation on the blockchain requires gas as it mutates the blockchain state. Read operations are free.
</Tip>

Managing gas is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the underlying blockchain. With WalletKit, the 
complexity is abstracted away from the developer, allowing you to focus on building your application.

In our developer dashboard, you can see the gas balance of your project wallet. And you can easily get gas by clicking
the `Buy` button.

It can also be done programmatically with the [Buy Gas API](/api-reference/gas/buy-gas) .

<Note>
On testnet, "buy gas" is free (subject to rate limit). On mainnet, the charge will bill to your monthly bill.

### Gasless Experience
Gas fees must be paid in order for a transaction to be completed. This cannot be avoided. What does gasless experience mean then? 
Gasless refers to a model in which users do not bear the cost of transaction fees. However, someone pays for the gas for a 
transaction to be completed. Sometimes development teams or project owners pay for the gas fee, allowing end-users to only pay 
for the services availed.

Wallekit strives to provide a gasless experience for the end users. Currently the custom token and NFT created on our 
platform support gasless transaction. With our API, your user can easily transfer your token or NFT without gas in their wallet.
The gas fee will be billed to your project.
