WalletKit lets you easily deploy custom tokens on any chains. Once deployed, the tokens are deposited in your project
wallet. From there, you can manage its supply by minting additional tokens or burning existing ones.

Combined with the [Transfer API](make-transfer), you can easily create a token-based features for your project such as
rewarding users for completing tasks or creating a marketplace.

### Using Dashboard
WalletKit provides no-code tools in the Dashboard to deploy custom tokens. To deploy a custom token, follow these steps:
1. Head over to the [Dashboard](https://app.usewalletkit.com/)
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Configure the token, by picking a name, symbol, logo, and its initial supply.
4. Finally, confirm the network you want to deploy on and click "Create Token"

### Using API

You can also programmatically deploy custom tokens using the
[Create Token API](http://localhost:3000/api-reference/tokens/create-token).

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node
import {WalletKitClient} from 'walletkit';
import {Network} from 'walletkit/api';

const wk = WalletKitClient.usingAPIKey({
  projectID: "<Project ID>",
  apiKey: "<API Key>"
});

const transaction = await wk.tokens.create({
  network: Network.Base,
  name: "Reward Points",
  symbol: "RPC",
  decimals: 6,
  displayDecimals: 2,
  initialSupply: "1000000",
  logoUrl: "https://example.org/token-logo.png",
  developer_secret: "testnet-secret"
});
```

```bash curl
  curl --request POST \
  --url https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/tokens \
  --user '<Project ID>:<API Key>' \
  --data '{
    "network": "Base",
    "name": "Reward Points",
    "symbol": "RPC",
    "decimals": 6,
    "initial_supply": "1000000",
