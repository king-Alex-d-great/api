Creating and distributing NFTs can be complicated and time-consuming, as it involves dealing with smart contracts, private key signing, paying for gas, and managing blockchain operations. With WalletKit, it will be a few simple HTTP API calls.

There are two simple highlevel concepts to understand when working with NFTs:
*  NFT - a non-fungible token that represents a unique asset.
*  NFT Collection - grouping of nfts, nfts in the same collection usually share the same theme.

Combined with the [Transfer endpoint](/nfts/make-transfer), you can easily create a NFT-based feature for your app, such
as membership identity, digital collectibles, and more.



## Using Dashboard


WalletKit provides no-code tools in the Dashboard to create NFT collection and mint NFT.

### Create Collection
To create a NFT collection, follow these steps:

1. Head over to the [Dashboard](https://app.usewalletkit.com)
2. Click “Create Collection
3. Configure the collection, by picking a name, symbol, and cover.
4. Finally, confirm the network you want to deploy on and click “Create”

### Mint NFT
To mint NFT, follow these steps:
1. In the dashboard, click on the collection you want to mint NFTs for.
2. Click “Mint NFT”
3. Configure the NFT, by picking a name, description, and image.
4. Finally, click "Mint NFT"

## Using API

You can also programmatically create NFT collection and mint NFT using the [Create NFT Collection endpoint](/api-reference/nfts/create-nft-collection)
and [Mint NFT endpoint](/api-reference/nfts/mint-nft).

### Create NFT Collection

Use the [Create NFT Collection endpoint](/api-reference/nfts/create-nft-collection) to create NFT collection.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript NextJS
import { WalletKitClient} from "walletkit-js/Client";
import { WalletKitEnvironment} from "walletkit-js";
import { TokenSource, Network } from "walletkit-js/api";

// Create an instance of WalletKitClient
const wk = new WalletKitClient({
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    environment: WalletKitEnvironment.Testnet,
    token: "SESSION_TOKEN",
    source: TokenSource.Walletkit,
});

const transaction = await wk.nfts.create({
  network: Network.Base,
  name: "Sky Airline Gold Member",
  symbol: "SAGM",
  imageUrl: "https://example.com/gold_membership",
  developerSecret: "testnet-secret"
});
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/nfts/collections' \
     --header 'X-WalletKit-Project-ID: <Project ID>' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API Key>' \
     --data '
{
   "network": "Base",
   "name": "Sky Airline Gold Member",
   "symbol": "SAGM",
   "image_url": "https://example.com/gold_membership",
   "developer_secret": "testnet-secret"
}
'
```
</CodeGroup>

The response returns a transaction object with a transaction id.
```json JSON
{
  "transaction_id": "11da23c2-fed1-4a37-963a-f7222041d6e3",
  "network": "Base",
  "status": "submitted",
}
```

You can monitor the status of the transaction by calling the
[Get Transaction Status](/api-reference/transactions/transaction-status-by-id) endpoint. WalletKit handles retries to
ensure that the transaction is successful.

Once the transaction is successful, the response will contain the contract address of the NFT collection, which will be
used in the minting step.

```json JSON
{
  "transaction_id": "11da23c2-fed1-4a37-963a-f7222041d6e3",
  "transaction_hash": "0x2f54260a6803d3b03b83580a168a79c384cc138c37cca93f76dd7c042c183457",
  "network": "Base",
  "status": "success",
  "contract_address": "0xD4Edb607A07BFe4D5678fA01a2773449465F1aD1"
}
```

### Upload NFT Image (Optional)

This step is optional if you already have the image hosted some where, and have the image uri ready to be used.

In the case where you would like to upload the image of NFT to be hosted on IPFS, use the [Upload NFT image endpoint](/api-reference/nfts/upload-nft-image).

<Tip>
Storing NFT images on IPFS is recommended, as it is decentralized and immutable.
</Tip>

```bash cURL
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/nfts/upload' \
  --header 'X-WalletKit-Project-ID: <Project ID>' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API Key>' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F file=@path/to/gold_membership.jpeg
```

An IPFS url will be returned by the API.

```json JSON
{"ipfs_url":"ipfs://bafybeies72zw3kxh3dmgsmwyh5th7wk4kovnodhahn32s3oruorihs7qua/gold_membership.jpeg"}
```

### Mint NFTs

Use [Mint NFT endpoint](/api-reference/nfts/mint-nft) to mint NFT with custom metadata.
Use recipient wallet address as the `recipient`, and the NFT collection created in previous step as `contract_address`. Put the image url in the`metadata.image` field.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node
import { WalletKit, WalletKitClient } from 'walletkit';

const wk = new WalletKitClient({
  projectId: '<Project ID>',
  token: '<API Key>'
});

const transaction = await wk.nfts.mint({
  network: WalletKit.Network.Base,
  contractAddress': '0xD4Edb607A07BFe4D5678fA01a2773449465F1aD1',
  recipient: '0x..',
  metadata: {
    name: 'Gold member #1',
    description: 'Skyline Airline Gold Member enjoys unlimited seat upgrades, 40% more awarded miles ...',
    image: '<image_url>'
  },
  developerSecret: 'testnet-secret'
});
```

```bash curl
  curl --request POST \
  --url https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/nfts/mint \
  --user '<Project ID>:<API Key>' \
  --data '{
    "network": "Base",
    "contract_address": "0xD4Edb607A07BFe4D5678fA01a2773449465F1aD1",
    "recipient": "0x..",
    "metadata": {
      "name": "Gold member #1",
      "description": "Skyline Airline Gold Member enjoys unlimited seat upgrades, 40% more awarded miles ...",
      "image": "<image_url>"
    },
    "developer_secret": "testnet-secret"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

Similar to create NFT collection, this endpoint returns a transaction object with a transaction id. You can monitor the status of the transaction by calling the
[Get Transaction Status](/api-reference/transactions/transaction-status-by-id) endpoint. WalletKit handles retries to
ensure that the transaction is successful.
