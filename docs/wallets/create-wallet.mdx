### Developer-controlled wallets
Developer-controlled wallets are where you create wallets on your users' behalf. This provides the most flexibility
in terms of what kind of user experiences you can create, but it also means that you have custody of your users' digital
assets.

#### Create a wallet
Creating a wallet is as simple as making an API call:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node
import { WalletKitClient } from 'walletkit';
import { WalletControlMode, Network } from 'walletkit/api';

const wk = WalletKitClient.usingAPIKey({
  projectID: '<Project ID>',
  apiKey: '<API Key>'
});

const wallet = await wk.wallets.create({
  network: Network.Base,
  name: 'My Wallet',
  controlMode: WalletControlMode.Developer,
  developer_secret: 'testnet-secret'
});
```

```bash curl
curl --request POST \
--url https://testnet.usewalletkit.com/wallets \
--user '<Project ID>:<API Key>' \
--data '{
  "network": "Base",
  "name": "My Wallet",
  "developer_secret": "testnet-secret"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

```javascript
{
  id: 'b14e78f5-caba-4b8a-b2bd-5aea61d1cc63',
  createdAt: '2023-09-04T22:01:10.96056Z',
  network: 'Base',
  name: 'My Wallet',
  address: '0x80f271955b35C2a7e578Ec9Db799a8da2144d0a4'
}
```

Visit the Wallets page in the [Dashboard](https://app.usewalletkit.com/wallets?network=Base) to see your newly created
wallet.

#### Owner ID
When creating a wallet, you can optionally specify an `owner_id`. This is a unique identifier for the user that owns the
wallet. Usually, this is the ID of the user in your database.

For each owner, WalletKit will create a single wallet for each network. If you create a wallet with the same `owner_id`
and `network` as an existing wallet, WalletKit will return the existing wallet instead of creating a new one.

<Info>
  For networks that support the same address format, WalletKit will reuse the same address for each wallet. For
  example, if you create a wallet for the `Ethereum` network and then create another wallet for the `Base` network
  with the same `owner_id`, WalletKit will return the same address for both wallets.
