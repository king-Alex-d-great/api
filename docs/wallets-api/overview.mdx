The Wallets API is a set of HTTP APIs that you can use to create and manage gasless wallets for your users.

This is the best way to integrate wallets in your app that allows you to have complete control over the user experience. Check out a demo app built with WalletKit API and a custom UI [here](https://demo.walletkit.com).

<Note>If you would like to use pre-built components for web, check out our [Connect](/connect) product.</Note>

### Get started
You can use one of our libraries to integrate with the Wallets API.

</CardGroup>

 If a library for your language is not available yet, you can use the HTTP APIs directly - skip over to the [Authentication](authentication/overview) step.
